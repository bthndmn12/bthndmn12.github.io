Hi, I'm Batuhan, I'm a computer engineer. I'm interested in a little bit of math and a little bit of machine learning and deep learning, so I've been trying to improve myself and learn new things in this field for two years. Right now I'm working on Computer Vision and especially Segmentation, but I don't know what will happen in the future :) I also have a 10 year old Raspberry Pi 1 Model B and I'm still doing stuff with it. I've also worked with Java and Processing and I'm still doing stuff with it. Apart from that I'm interested in music. I play the piano as an amateur... if you can call it playing. You can check out my Soundcloud account if you want.
