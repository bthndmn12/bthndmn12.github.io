Hi, I'm Batuhan, a newly graduated computer engineer. I'm interested in statistics, probability, and machine learning, so I've been trying to improve myself and learn new things in this field for two years. I also have a 10-year-old Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, and I'm still doing something with it. I've also worked with Java and Processing, and I'm still doing something with it. I like algorithms and Leetcode. Apart from these, I'm interested in music. I play the piano as an amateur... if you can call it playing. You can check out my Soundcloud account if you want.
